                        sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of "bodily injury" or
                        "property damage" to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend the
                        insured against any "suit" seeking those damages. However, we will have no duty to defend the
                        insured against any "suit" seeking damages for "bodily injury" or "property damage" to which
                        this insurance does not apply. We may, at our discretion, investigate any "occurrence" and

                <p>(1) The amount we will pay for damages is limited as described in Section III – Limits Of Insurance;
                    and</p>
                <p>(2) Our right and duty to defend ends when we have used up the applicable limit of insurance in the

                <p>No other obligation or liability to pay sums or perform acts or services is covered unless explicitly

                <p>(1) The "bodily injury" or "property damage" is caused by an "occurrence" that takes place in the
                    "coverage territory";</p>
                <p>(2) The "bodily injury" or "property damage" occurs during the policy period; and</p>

                    Insured and no "employee" authorized by you to give or receive notice of an "occurrence" or claim,
                    knew that the "bodily injury" or "property damage" had occurred, in whole or in part. If such a

                    or "property damage" occurred, then any continuation, change or resumption of such "bodily injury"
                    or "property damage" during or after the policy period will be deemed to have been known prior to
                    the policy period.</p>

                    an "occurrence" or claim, includes any continuation, change or resumption of that "bodily injury" or
                    "property damage" after the end of the policy period.</p>

                <p><strong>d.</strong> "Bodily injury" or "property damage" will be deemed to have been known to have
                    occurred at the earliest time when any insured listed under Paragraph 1. of Section II – Who Is An
                    Insured or any "employee" authorized by you to give or receive notice of an "occurrence" or claim:
                </p>
                <p>(1) Reports all, or any part, of the "bodily injury" or "property damage" to us or any other insurer;
                </p>
                <p>(2) Receives a written or verbal demand or claim for damages because of the "bodily injury" or
                    "property damage"; or</p>
                <p>(3) Becomes aware by any other means that "bodily injury" or "property damage" has occurred or has
                    begun to occur.</p>

                <p><strong>e.</strong> Damages because of "bodily injury" include damages claimed by any person or
                    organization for care, loss of services or death resulting at any time from the "bodily injury".</p>

                <p><strong>b. Contractual Liability</strong></p>
                <p>"Bodily injury" or "property damage" for which the insured is obligated to pay damages by reason of

                    "property damage" occurs subsequent to the execution of the contract or agreement. Solely for the
                    purposes of liability assumed in an "insured contract", reasonable attorneys' fees and necessary
                    litigation expenses incurred by or for a party other than an insured are deemed to be damages
                    because of "bodily injury" or "property damage", provided:</p>
                <p>(a) Liability to such party for, or for the cost of, that party's defense has also been assumed in
                    the same "insured contract"; and</p>
                <p>(b) Such attorneys' fees and litigation expenses are for defense of that party against a civil or
                    alternative dispute resolution proceeding in which damages to which this insurance applies are
                    alleged.</p>

                <p><strong>c. Liquor Liability</strong></p>

                <p>(1) Causing or contributing to the intoxication of any person;</p>
                <p>(2) The furnishing of alcoholic beverages to a person under the legal drinking age or under the
                    influence of alcohol; or</p>
                <p>(3) Any statute, ordinance or regulation relating to the sale, gift, distribution or use of alcoholic
                    beverages.</p>
                <p>This exclusion applies even if the claims allege negligence or other wrongdoing in:</p>
